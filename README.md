# Financial-Planning-with-APIs-and-Simulations

This repo contains the results of the module 5 challenge. I assumed the role of a financial consultant that focuses on projects to benefit local communities. This project entails building a tool to help members of a local credit union evaluate their financial health. 

Specifically, the credit union board wants the members to be able to do two things. First, they should be able to assess their monthly budgets. Second, they should be able to forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. I created two financial analysis tools using a single Jupyter notebook:

(1) A financial planner for emergencies. The members are now able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

(2) A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in both 10 and 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

I used the information from the Monte Carlo simulations to answer questions about each portfolio in a Jupyter notebook.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For manipulating data

* [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations

* [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - For scientific computing with Python

## Installation Guide

Using the Pandas read_csv function and the Path module, import the data from the `whale_navs.csv` containing the data about portfolios with net asset value (NAV) pricing from four whale investors. The file also contains data about the S&P 500 index, which will serve as the benchmark for your analysis.

Use the read_csv function and the Path module to read the `whale_navs.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame. Be sure to create a DateTimeIndex. Review the first five rows of the DataFrame by using the head function.

Use the Pandas pct_change function together with dropna to create the daily returns DataFrame. Base this DataFrame on the NAV prices of the four portfolios and on the closing price of the S&P 500 Index. Review the first five rows of the daily returns DataFrame.

```python
  from pathlib import Path
    
    whale_data = Path("../Resources/whale_navs.csv")
    whale_df = pd.read_csv(whale_data, index_col="date", infer_datetime_format=True, parse_dates=True)
    
    whale_daily_returns = whale_df.pct_change().dropna()

    whale_daily_returns.head()
```

## **Analyze the Performance**

Based on the analysis in this section, we answer the question: 

(1) Do any of the four fund portfolios outperform the S&P 500 Index?

```python
whale_cumulative_returns.plot(figsize=(15,7), title="Fund NAV & S&P 500 Cumulative Returns")
```

* ![Fund NAV & S&P 500 Cumulative Returns](/Screenshots/Fund_NAV_S&P_500_Cumulative_Returns.png) 


## **Analyze the Volatility**

Here, we answer the question: 

(2) Based on the box plot visualization of just the four fund portfolios, which fund was the most volatile (with the greatest spread) and which was the least volatile (with the smallest spread)?

```python
fund_daily_returns.plot(kind='box', title="Fund NAV Daily Returns",rot=45)
```

* ![Fund NAV Daily Returns](/Screenshots/Fund_NAV_Daily_Returns.png)


## **Analyze the Risk**

In this section, we answer the following three questions: 

(3) Based on the annualized standard deviation, which portfolios pose more risk than the S&P 500?

(4) Based on the rolling metrics, does the risk of each portfolio increase at the same time that the risk of the S&P 500 increases?

(5) Based on the rolling standard deviations of only the four fund portfolios, which portfolio poses the most risk? Does this change over time?

```python
whale_std_21.plot(figsize=(10,7), title="Fund NAV and S&P 500 21 Day Standard Deviation")
```

* ![Fund NAV and S&P 500 21 Day Standard Deviation](/Screenshots/Fund_NAV_and_S&P_500_21_Day_Standard_Deviation.png)

```python
fund_std_21.plot(figsize=(10,7), title="Fund NAV 21 Day Standard Deviation")
```

* ![Fund NAV 21 Day Standard Deviation](/Screenshots/Fund_NAV_21_Day_Standard_Deviation.png)

## **Analyze the Risk-Return Profile**

Here, we answer the question: 

(6) Which of the four portfolios offers the best risk-return profile? Which offers the worst?

```python
whale_sharpe_ratios.plot.bar(figsize=(10, 7), title="Fund NAV and S&P 500 Sharpe Ratios")
```

## **Diversify the Portfolio**

In this final section, I evaluated how two portfolios react relative to the broader market. I choose two portfolios that I would most likely to recommend as investment option and answer the following questions: 

(7) Which of the two portfolios seem more sensitive to movements in the S&P 500?

```python
bh_rolling_60_beta.plot(figsize=(10,7), title="BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC - 60 Day Rolling Beta")
```

* ![BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC - 60 Day Rolling Beta](/Screenshots/BERKSHIRE_HATHAWAY_INC-60_Day_Rolling_Beta.png)

(8) Which of the two portfolios do you recommend for inclusion in your firmâ€™s suite of fund offerings?

```python
tg_rolling_60_beta.plot(figsize=(10,7), title="TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC - 60 Day Rolling Beta")
```

* ![TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC - 60 Day Rolling Beta](/Screenshots/TIGER_GLOBAL_MANAGEMENT_LLC.png)
